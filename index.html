                                <li><strong>Cross-community learning:</strong> You learned youth engagement from the rec center, taught them elder outreach</li>

                                <li><strong>Collective insights:</strong> Together discovered that community validators increase participation 70%</li>

                            <p><strong>The transformation:</strong> By learning from each other's community relationships, sharing failures openly, and building knowledge together, every organization serves communities better.</p>
